## Adapter installation
Drop the .properties file for your Adapter(s) in here either before or after you have started Loom to load them.

Add the .jar file and corresponding dependencies into a directory that matches your adapterDir property.

NOTE: If doing an Adapter install at runtime, make sure you put the .jar file in first!
